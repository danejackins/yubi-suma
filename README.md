# yubi-suma

"Yubisuma is a traditional number guessing game played in Asian countries such as Singapore. I used to play this too when I lived in Singapore as a child. The main objective of the game is to guess the number of thumbs, which the participants will raise. There is no limit to the number of players that can join the game. To start, the fists must be closed and placed together, inner wrist to inner wrist. Considering two players, one player will take a guess on the number of thumbs that will be raised by both players. For this case, a number from 0 to 4 can be chosen. Upon selecting the number, the player will say carefully “Yubi-suma”, and the number of his or her choice. At the same moment that the number was stated, both players must be able to raise or not raise one or raise both or none of their thumbs. The player wins if he guessed the correct number of thumbs raised."*
